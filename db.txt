TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the foundational suite of communication protocols used to connect devices on the internet and most local networks. Think of it as the language computers use to talk to each other across networks. TCP ensures data is reliably sent and received in the correct order, like a careful mail carrier making sure no message gets lost or jumbled. Meanwhile, IP handles addressing and routing, making sure each data packet reaches the right destination, much like a GPS guiding letters to the correct address. Together, they form the core framework that makes the web work!
